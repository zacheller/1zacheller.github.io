title: ACM x b34rshell Cybersecurity Panel at WashU
---

On October 12th 2022, I spoke on a cybersecurity panel at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) with Ryan Xu, another founding member of the university CTF team, b34r5hell. It was awesome to have the opportunity to speak to current WashU students about getting into the cybersecurity industry. Thanks to Misheel Sodgerel, the WashU ACM Chapter President, and the current b34r5hell team for organizing the event and inviting me to be a panelist!
